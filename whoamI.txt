Hey I'm Matthew,

I am a recent grad from the Univiercity of Alberta with a major in
computer science.

I worked with a Y-Combinator backed social media start up called
ChillaBit. I developed their android application.

I'm also into AI and bots right now. I entered a starcraft AI
tournament and my team won first place. :)

I am really exited for an oppertunity to work for amazon, I am a
huge fan of AWS and Amazon prime. I'm exited for the chance that my
work could effect so many customers.
